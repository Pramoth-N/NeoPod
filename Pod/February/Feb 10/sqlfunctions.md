| COLUMN NAME  | DATA TYPE |
|-------------|----------|
| PRODUCT_ID  | INT      |
| PRODUCT_NAME | VARCHAR |
| PRICE       | DECIMAL  |
| STOCK       | INT      |

### **Tasks**  

Write SQL queries to extract the following insights:  

1. **Stock Difference Calculation:**  
   - Calculate the absolute difference between the stock of each product and **200 units**.  
   - Use the alias name **STOCK_DIFFERENCE**.  
   - Display it along with **PRODUCT_NAME** from the `PRODUCTS` table.  

2. **Rounded-Down Price:**  
   - Get the **rounded-down price** value for each product.  
   - Use the alias name **NEW_PRICE**.  
   - Display it along with **PRODUCT_NAME** from the `PRODUCTS` table.  

3. **Rounded-Up Price:**  
   - Get the **rounded-up price** value for each product.  
   - Use the alias name **NEW_PRICE**.  
   - Display it along with **PRODUCT_NAME** from the `PRODUCTS` table.  

4. **Price Remainder Calculation:**  
   - Determine the remainder when the **TOTAL_PRICE** of each order is divided by **100**.  
   - Use the alias name **PRICE_REMAINDER**.  
   - Display it along with **ORDER_ID** and **PRODUCT_ID** from the `ORDERS` table.  

5. **Quantity Squared:**  
   - Calculate the **square of the QUANTITY ordered** for each order.  
   - Use the alias name **QUANTITY_SQUARED**.  
   - Display it along with **ORDER_ID** and **PRODUCT_ID** from the `ORDERS` table.  

6. **Rounded Total Price:**  
   - Round the **TOTAL_PRICE** of each order to the nearest whole number.  
   - Use the alias name **ROUNDED_TOTAL_PRICE**.  
   - Display it along with **ORDER_ID** and **PRODUCT_ID** from the `ORDERS` table.  

---

### **Input Format**  
- The tables `PRODUCTS` and `ORDERS` are **already created and prepopulated**.  
- You **only need to write SQL queries** to extract the required results.  

### **Output Format**  
- The queries should return the requested values in tabular format.

This question tests your ability to apply **numeric functions** (`ABS()`, `FLOOR()`, `CEIL()`, `MOD()`, `POWER()`, `ROUND()`) in SQL effectively. ðŸš€

Here are the SQL queries to extract the required data using numeric functions:  

```sql
-- 1. Calculate the absolute difference between stock and 200
SELECT PRODUCT_NAME, ABS(STOCK - 200) AS STOCK_DIFFERENCE 
FROM PRODUCTS;

-- 2. Get the rounded-down price value
SELECT PRODUCT_NAME, FLOOR(PRICE) AS NEW_PRICE 
FROM PRODUCTS;

-- 3. Get the rounded-up price value
SELECT PRODUCT_NAME, CEIL(PRICE) AS NEW_PRICE 
FROM PRODUCTS;

-- 4. Determine the remainder when total price is divided by 100
SELECT ORDER_ID, PRODUCT_ID, MOD(TOTAL_PRICE, 100) AS PRICE_REMAINDER 
FROM ORDERS;

-- 5. Calculate the square of the quantity ordered
SELECT ORDER_ID, PRODUCT_ID, POWER(QUANTITY, 2) AS QUANTITY_SQUARED 
FROM ORDERS;

-- 6. Round the total price to the nearest whole number
SELECT ORDER_ID, PRODUCT_ID, ROUND(TOTAL_PRICE) AS ROUNDED_TOTAL_PRICE 
FROM ORDERS;
```

These queries use numeric functions like `ABS()`, `FLOOR()`, `CEIL()`, `MOD()`, `POWER()`, and `ROUND()` to generate the required results. Let me know if you need any modifications! ðŸš€
