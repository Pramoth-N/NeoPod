/*
 * 
 * You are given a sentence where each word contains an embedded number (from 0
 * to 9) that indicates the position of that word in the final sorted sentence.
 * Your task is to reconstruct and sort the sentence based on these embedded
 * numbers. Each number represents the index of the word in the sorted sentence,
 * starting from 0. Input format A single line containing a sentence with words,
 * where each word includes a single digit (0-9) indicating its position in the
 * final sorted sentence. Output format A single line containing the
 * reconstructed and sorted sentence based on the embedded numbers. â€¢Print
 * Invalid input, if more than one word contains same integers. Constraints The
 * sentence will only contain words separated by single spaces. Each word will
 * have exactly one embedded digit (0-9). -1<= Length of string <= 100 There
 * will be no duplicate positions in the sentence.
